mic1

This repository contains tools for working with the MIC-1 system and
is primarily used for the UMass Lowell 91.305 course.

masm - assembler
 mcc - microcode compiler
mic1 - simulator
 rkt - tools rewritten in Racket

Run `make` at the top level to build everything you need to run
programs.

The code was written over the years by
- Jim Canning
- Jim Canning's students
- Richard Boccuzzi
- Bill Moloney
(subsequent authors will not be added to this list, but will be
reflected in the Git logs)

TODO list
- Document the tools
- Add symbol table export from masm to mic1 debugger
- Change mic1 debugger to allow debugging of microcode
  (currently it resets mcpc to 0)
- Change mcc to have a symbol table and not require lines
- Simplify masm implementation
